This library was developed for the paper 'Model free approach to planning for anytime algorithms' published at the International conference for robotics and automation, 2020 in Paris, France.
The library implements the following features:

1. An RL environment definition for the solution profile generated by the following algorithms working on a travelling salesman problem:

  a. Lin-Kernighan heuristic
  b. Genetic algorithms

2. Q-learning and SARSA RL algorithms

3. Fourier function approximator for these algorithms.

4. REINFORCE with a multi layer perceptron policy

Results are in the pdfs aupplied with the library
